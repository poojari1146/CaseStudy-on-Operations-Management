🚗 General Motors & the Global Microchip Shortage – Operations Management Case Study<br>
| A supply chain disruption analysis focused on GM’s semiconductor shortage, with sourcing, demand planning, and strategic recommendations to build future resilience.<br>
📘 Overview<br>
This operations management case study explores the microchip shortage crisis faced by General Motors (GM) during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the world’s largest automakers, GM was hit hard by supply chain disruptions that halted production across several plants and delayed vehicle deliveries globally.

Analyzing this issue through the lens of Sourcing & Supply Chain Management and Demand Planning, while proposing actionable strategies for GM to future-proof its operations.<br>
🎯 Key Business Problem<br>
- A global shortage of semiconductors crippled GM’s production capacity and forced temporary closures at major plants.
- Increased demand for personal electronics during the pandemic diverted chip supply from automotive to consumer tech.
- GM’s reliance on global suppliers, especially in Taiwan, left the company vulnerable.
- Forecasting challenges and lack of inventory buffer worsened the impact.<br>
📊 Analysis Framework<br>
- 📦 Sourcing & Supply Management
  - GM's supply chain was global and linear, lacking flexibility.
  - Semiconductor suppliers prioritized more profitable clients (e.g., smartphone makers).
  - GM relied on just-in-time manufacturing, leaving no margin for disruption.
  - COVID-19 and Texas storms further disrupted chip manufacturing.
  - New strategy: Shift toward North American sourcing, long-term contracts, and in-house chip development by 2025.
- 📈 Demand Planning
  - Poor forecasting left GM underprepared for the demand rebound in 2021.
  - GM had to build cars without chips and store them until components arrived.
  - New demand planning should:
     1. Integrate real-time data and sales trends
     2. Use Pareto analysis to track top customers
     3. Incorporate bottom-up and top-down forecasting
     4. Adapt to seasonality and supply-side risks
🔄 Strategic Recommendations<br>
- Build and stockpile critical semiconductors
- Vertically integrate chip production (goal set for 2025)
- Simplify chip requirements across product lines
- Retrofit features post-sale when chips are available
- Implement supplier training and sustainability KPIs
- Adopt hybrid sourcing and analytics-driven inventory management
- Adjust vehicle features to include only essential tech during shortages<br>
📍 Real Outcomes Observed
- Shifted production timelines to meet market demand quickly
- Restarted closed assembly plants in Oshawa and CAMI
- Partnered with Qualcomm, Infineon, and others for new microcontroller families
- Dealer inventory and chip availability started improving in late 2022
- Set a production goal of 1M+ electric vehicles annually by 2025<br>
